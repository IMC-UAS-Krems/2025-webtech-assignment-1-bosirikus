                <h2>Who I am</h2>
                <p>Hey! I'm Boris Dimitrov, a first-year Informatics student at IMC Krems. I believe in working hard but
                    also enjoying the journey along the way. When I'm not buried in code or studying for exams, you'll
                    probably find me at the gym, at a concert, or planning my next adventure.</p>

                    <h3>🎵 Music Taste</h3>
                    <p> <strong> Heavy metal enthusiast - the heavier, the better! </strong></p>

                    <p>Since I was very little my father has been constantly influencig my music-taste. Half
                        of what we were
                        listening
                        in the car was heavy metal. Needless to say he took me with him on concerts and I started
                        enjoying
                        this type of
                        genre. Still I enjoy all kinds of music and I like almost everything. Metal may be my favourite,
                        but
                        music overall
                        has always been special for me.

                    <h3>✈️ Passion</h3>

                    <p><strong>I'm always planning my next trip or my next workout.</strong></p>

                    <p>What I love most is travelling and training. These two, along with gaming, are my favourite ways
                        to
                        unwind when I need to blow off some steam. I firmly believe that physical exercise is one of the
                        best ways to relieve mental tension.
                    </p>



                    <p>Travelling, on the other hand, helps me gain perspective on where I stand in the world, and how
                        people can be both remarkably different and surprisingly similar depending on where they were
                        born.<br>
                        When neither of those is an option, I like to stay at home, watch a good movie, or
                        play a video game. I'm a proud nerd who loves fantasy, sci-fi, and all things comic
                        book-related.
